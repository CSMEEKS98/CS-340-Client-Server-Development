Throughout this course, I’ve developed skills in writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, especially through my work on the CRUD Python module from Project One. This module allowed me to cleanly separate database logic from the front-end dashboard in Project Two, making it easier to reuse, modify, and debug. By designing modular code, I ensured that database operations could be maintained or replaced independently of the dashboard interface, which is a valuable approach in real-world software development. This experience helped me appreciate the value of abstraction and separation of concerns in system design.

As a computer science student, I approached Grazioso Salvare’s database requirements by breaking the problem down into functional components—data storage, filtering, visualization, and interactivity. Compared to previous assignments, this project required deeper attention to user experience and real-time data integration. I applied principles like data validation, error handling, and user feedback to ensure the dashboard worked reliably under various input conditions. In the future, I would apply similar modular and test-driven strategies to create robust, scalable dashboards for other clients.

This project also reinforced my understanding of what computer scientists do: they analyze problems, design systems, and build tools that empower others to make informed decisions. My work on this project helps a company like Grazioso Salvare make data-driven selections in high-stakes rescue operations. It matters because it saves time, increases accuracy, and ultimately contributes to saving lives. Working on this type of project helped me see how technical solutions can serve real human needs.
